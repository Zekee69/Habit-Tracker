2. Technical Architecture

2.1 System Architecture Overview
The application follows a modern component-based architecture built on Next.js App Router:
Application Layer
├── Presentation Layer (React Components)
├── Business Logic Layer (Custom Hooks & Utilities)
├── Data Layer (Local State Management)
└── UI Layer (Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui)

2.3 Data Flow Architecture
The application implements a unidirectional data flow pattern:
1.	User Interaction → Component event handlers
2.	State Updates → React hooks (useState, useEffect)
3.	UI Re-rendering → Automatic React updates
4.	Visual Feedback → User interface updates
